      <p>I'm a science teacher at New West Charter School. This is my teacher home page.</p>

        <h2> <a href="physics/index.html">Physics</a></h2>
         <p><b>Physics is science.</b> Physics is the natural science that involves the study of matter and its motion through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, the main
             goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves.
         </p>
         <p><b>Physics is technology.</b> For example, physics is behind all the different technologies in a cell phone. We will study how electromagnetic waves encode information between a cell phone and tower, how electricity in the computer chips is controlled
             by transistors, resistors, and other elements, how a phone's speaker produces changing waves of air pressure, how a phone uses GPS to know its position, and more!
         </p>
         <p><b>Physics is engineering.</b> This class will reward a curious mind that wants to apply their knowledge of physics to design, build, tinker, and experiment.
         </p>
         <p><b>Physics is math.</b> Physics makes math less abstract and more concrete. Students will hone their math skills on real world problems giving their math skills a greater relevance and fluidity.</p>
         <br>
         <h2> <a href="http://codepen.io/lilgreenland/">Computer Science</a></h2>
        <p>This class focuses on the fundamentals of computer science.  Students will learn programing by creating projects in a few different languages and by direct instruction on basic principles.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2> <a href="http://www.newwestcharter.org/">Student Government</a></h2>
        <p>Student Government is filled with the students who want to actively participate in their school’s events and issues. These students strive to add to the student body’s experience in a positive manner.  Each of them work hard in their groups to benefit student life, advertisement for events, etc..</p>

        <h1 class='underlined'>About Me</h1>
        <p>I graduated from University of Georgia with a B.S. in physics and astronomy. After college I moved to Los Angeles and got credentialed to teach high school physics and chemistry. I’ve been teaching physics, chemistry, and computer programming
            in California for the last 9 years. Before joining New West I was both the dean of students and chemistry teacher at SLO Classical Academy.</p>

        <p>I nerd out on: books, hiking, soccer, science, computer programming</p>
