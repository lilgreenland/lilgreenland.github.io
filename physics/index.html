      <p><b>Physics is science.</b> Physics is the natural science that involves the study of matter and its motion through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, the main
          goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves.
      </p>
      <p><b>Physics is technology.</b> Physics is behind all the different technologies in a cell phone.  Students will be able to explain how electromagnetic waves encode information between a cell
          phone and tower, how electricity in the computer chips is controlled by transistors, resistors, and other elements, how you hear your phone's speaker produces changing waves of air pressure, how your phone uses GPS to know its position, and more!
      </p>
      <p><b>Physics is engineering.</b> Students will discover and observe physics directly in the lab. This class will reward a curious mind that wants to apply their knowledge of physics to design, build, tinker, and experiment.
      </p>

      <p><b>Physics is math.</b> Students will hone their math skills on real world situations. Solving grounded physics problems gives your math ability a relevance and fluidity.  Physics makes math less abstract and more concrete.
