        <h1>Physics - Landgreen</h1>
        <p><b>Physics is science.</b> Physics is the natural science that involves the study of matter and its motion through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, the main
            goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves.
        </p>
        <p><b>Physics is technology.</b> By the end of this course students should be able to explain the working principles of technology, like a cell phone. Students will be able to explain how electromagnetic waves encode information between the cell
            phone and the tower, and how electricity in the computer chips is controlled by transistors, resistors and other elements, how you hear your phone's speaker as changing waves of air pressure, how your phone uses an accelerometer to know its orientation,
            and more!
        </p>
        <p><b>Physics is engineering.</b> Students will discover and observe physics directly in the lab. This class will reward a curious mind that wants to understand how the universe works.
        </p>

        <p><b>Physics is math.</b> Students will hone their math skills by solving physics problems. Solving grounded physics problems gives your math ability a relevance and fluidity that makes math less abstract.
