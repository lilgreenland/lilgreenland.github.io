        <h1>Newton's Laws</h1>

        <h3>First law:</h3> When viewed in an inertial reference frame, an object either remains at rest or continues to move at a constant velocity, unless acted upon by an external force.
        <h3>Second law:</h3> The vector sum of the external forces F on an object is equal to the mass m of that object multiplied by the acceleration vector a of the object.
        <h3>Third law:</h3> When one body exerts a force on a second body, the second body simultaneously exerts a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on the first body.
        <hr>
        <h3>Newton's Second law:</h3> The vector sum of the external forces F on an object is equal to the mass m of that object multiplied by the acceleration vector a of the object.

        <p><b>F = force</b> [N, Newtons, kg m/s<sup>2</sup>]
          <br>A force is something that will try to accelerate an object. Like a push or a pull.</p>
        <p><b>Σ = sigma</b>  The greek letter Sigma represents the summation of numbers to find the total.  In this equation it means add up all the forces to get a total force.
          <b><p style = 'text-align: center;'> F<sub>1</sub>+F<sub>2</sub>+F<sub>3</sub>+F<sub>4</sub> + ... = ma </p></b>
        <p><b>m = mass</b> [kg, kilogram]
          <br>Mass is a measure of an object's resistance to acceleration when a force is applied.</p>
        <p><b>a = acceleration</b> [m/s<sup>2</sup>]
          <br>Acceleration is the change in velocity over time.

          <p><b>Example:</b> On a corner kick you use the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OSrvzNW9FE&t=1m39s">Magnus Effect</a> curve the ball into the goal.  To approximate the magnus effect assume the ball has a net force of 1N towards the goal.  How much acceleration does that produce on a 0.43 kg soccerball?  How much does the ball deviate from it's original path after 1.5 seconds?</p>
