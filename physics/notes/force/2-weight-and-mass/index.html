        <h3>Mass</h3>
        <li>Mass is a measure of an object's resistance to acceleration from a force.</li>
        <li>Low mass objects will accelerate more from the same force while high mass objects will accerelate less. A force that can move a bicycle will barely budge a car.</li>

        <h3>Mass and Gravity</h3>
        Mass also determines the strength of the force of gravity.  If the earth had more mass the force of gravity would be larger.  All massive objects are attracted towards each other, but we mostly notice the attraction towards the earth because it is so large and so close.
        <h3>The force of gravity</h3>
        <li>Another word for the force of gravity is <b>weight</b>.</li>
        <li>An object on the Moon would weigh less than it does on Earth because of the lower gravity, but it would still have the same mass.</li>

          <b>F<sub>g</sub></b> = the force of gravity, weight [N, Newtons, nonmetric: pounds] <i>vector</i>

          <br><b>g</b> = acceleration of gravity on the surface of the earth = 9.8 [m/s<sup>2</sup>] <i>vector</i>
        </div>
          <br>
          
          <li>9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup> is just an approxomation.</li>
          <li>Gravity actually changes depending <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0ahUKEwj-18b3h4vOAhUP8GMKHZdRDXEQygQIITAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FGravity_of_Earth%23Comparative_gravities_in_various_cities_around_the_world&usg=AFQjCNG39hIuYnaZ6-GLPvL5t6aHJa8NSA&bvm=bv.127984354,d.cGc&cad=rja">where you are</a>.</li>
          <li>It is 9.79607 m/s<sup>2</sup> in Los Angeles!</li>
          <li>Gravity dereases by 90% for astronauts in oribit around earth, but they don't notice any gravity because they are in a freefall. </li>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>Why would the acceleration of gravity seem lower near the equator?  </p>

<p><b>Example:</b> The hardcover version of the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seveneves-Neal-Stephenson/dp/0062334514/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1469380084&sr=1-1&keywords=Seveneves">Seveneves</a> by Neal Stephenson has a mass of 0.95kg.  What is the force of gravity felt by the book on earth?  What about on the <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=gravity+on+the+moon">moon</a>?</p>

  <summary>solution</summary>
  <p style = 'text-align: center;'>weight on earth:</p>
  $$F_{g}=ma_{g}$$
  $$F_{g}=0.95(9.8)$$
  $$F_{g}=9.31N$$
  <br>
  <p style = 'text-align: center;'>weight on moon:</p>
  $$F_{g}=ma_{g}$$
  $$F_{g}=0.95(1.6)$$
  $$F_{g}=1.52N$$

<p><b>Example:</b> The book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Uprooted-Naomi-Novik/dp/0804179034">Uprooted by Naomi Novik</a> is resting on a table.  Amazon says the shipping weight is 1.2 pounds.
<li>What is the mass in kilograms of the book on earth? On mars?
<li>What is the weight of the book in Newtons on earth (a = 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>)? On mars (a=3.711 m/s<sup>2</sup>)?
</p>

<details>
  <summary>solution</summary>
  <p style = 'text-align: center;'> mass is the constant everywhere</p>
  $$ 1.2lbs \frac{1kg}{2.2lbs} = 0. \overline{54}kg $$
  $$ m = 0. \overline{54} kg $$
<br>
  <p style = 'text-align: center;'>weight on Earth</p>
  $$F=ma$$
  $$F=(0.\overline{54})(9.8)$$
  $$F=5.35N$$
  <br>
  <p style = 'text-align: center;'> weight on Mars</p>
  $$F=ma$$
  $$F=(0.\overline{54})(3.711)$$
  $$F=2.02N$$
