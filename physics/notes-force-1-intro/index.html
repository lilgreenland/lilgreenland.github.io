        <h1>Newton's Laws</h1>

        <h3>First law:</h3> When viewed in an inertial reference frame, an object either remains at rest or continues to move at a constant velocity, unless acted upon by an external force.
        <h3>Second law:</h3> The vector sum of the external forces F on an object is equal to the mass m of that object multiplied by the acceleration vector a of the object.
        <h3>Third law:</h3> When one body exerts a force on a second body, the second body simultaneously exerts a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on the first body.

        <h1>$$F=ma$$</h1>
        <p><b>F = force</b> [N, Newtons, kg m/s<sup>2</sup>]
          <br>A force is something that will try to accelerate an object. Like a push or a pull.</p>
        <p><b>m = mass</b> [kg, kilogram]
          <br>Mass is a measure of an object's resistance to acceleration when a force is applied.</p>
        <p><b>a = acceleration</b> [m/s<sup>2</sup>]
          <br>Acceleration is the change in velocity over time.
